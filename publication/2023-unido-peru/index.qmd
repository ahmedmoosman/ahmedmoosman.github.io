## Abstract

This block identifies the main obstacles to doing business in Ukraine. It assesses ukraineâ€™s governance and policymaking capacities to address these obstacles and to promote the development of the domestic manufacturing sector. The block concludes with a discussion of potential policy solutions and assesses their effectiveness in the Ukrainian context, considering the reality of the ongoing war. To streamline narrative flow and help readers come away with a better grasp of the ideas presented, the main bottlenecks are classified into two groups: (1) factors of production and (2) governance.
